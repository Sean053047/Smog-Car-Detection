conf_thresh: yolov7 bbox should at least be larger than iou_thresh

iou_thresh : yolov7 non maximum suppresssion threshold



track_thresh : 
    > thresh => HIGH score bbox; 
    < thresh => Low score bbox
 
track_buffer : The number shows how many frames unmathed track would be saved into lost list.

match_thresh : It's a boundary which shows whether the current iou_distance is large enough to match a track.

min_box_area : if bbox.area > min_box_area then inference() will draw the bbox.
